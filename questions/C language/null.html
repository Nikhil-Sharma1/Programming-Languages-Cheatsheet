<h3>Q. What is null pointer?</h3>
<h3>Ans.</h3> Null is used to indicate that the pointer doesn't point to a valid location.<br>
Ideally, we should initialize pointers as NULL if we don't know their value at the point of declaration.<br>
Also, we should make a pointer NULL when memory pointed by it is deallocated in the middle of the program.
