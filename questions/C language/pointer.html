<h3>Q. When should we use pointers in a C program?</h3>
<h3>Ans.</h3><ol start=1><li>To get address of a variable.</li>
<li>For achieving pass by reference in C: pointers allow different functions to share and modify their local variables.</li>
<li>To pass large structures so that complete copy of the structure can be avoided.</li>
<li>To implement "linked" data structures like linked lists and binary trees.</li></ol>
